# PlasticitySandbox
Exploring computational inelasticity with simple problems in Python.

The notation and logic follows Simo and Hughes's Computational Inelasticity:
```
@book{simo1998,
	author = {Simo, J. C. and Hughes, T. J. R.},
	title = {{Computational Inelasticity}},
	journal = {SpringerLink},
	year = {1998},
	isbn = {978-0-387-22763-4},
	publisher = {Springer},
	address = {New York, NY, USA},
	url = {https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/b98904},
	keywords = {Applied Mathematics, Calculation, Finite, Mathematica, algorithms, calculus, equation, finite element method, mathematics, numerical analysis, optimization},
}
```

## Demos

Demo 1D implements an example from Chapter 1 of Computational Inelasticity.
